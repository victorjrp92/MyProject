# MyProject

I start cleaning and filtering:
I deleted the NaN's columns and rows, I get the info from the DataFrame with the intentions of analise the information and try to get some questions to plant the hypothesis.

First hypotesis
based on the document I plan to demonstrate that the most fatal species of the 3 most mentioned is the bull shark.

Second hypotesis
I'll use the database to demonstrate that American women experience the most non-lethal shark attacks.
